'''
Defining a class method with the name __init__ would overwrite this special behavior and likely lead to unexpected results and confusion. It's best to follow the convention and reserve the name __init__ specifically for the constructor.

Purpose:
__init__: Used as the constructor to initialize the instance variables of an object when it's created.
Class method: Used to define methods that operate on the class itself rather than on instances. It can be used for tasks that involve the class as a whole, such as creating class-level variables or performing operations that don't depend on specific instances.

Invocation:
__init__: Automatically called when a new instance of the class is created using the class name followed by parentheses (e.g., obj = MyClass()).
Class method: Can be called on the class itself or on instances of the class, using the @classmethod decorator. It receives the class (cls) as its first parameter instead of the instance (self).

Instance Variables:
__init__: Typically used to initialize instance variables specific to each instance of the class.
Class method: Typically used to manipulate class variables shared by all instances of the class.
